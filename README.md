# Impacts on Society

**Course:** AP Computer Science Principals 

**Description:** The Mobile Computer Science Principles course provides an introduction to the basic principles of computer science (CS) from the perspective of mobile computing, including programming in MIT App Inventor, a graphical programming language for Android and iOS mobile devices. The lessons and materials used by students incorporate algorithms and programming while also integrating all other AP CSP big ideas: creative development, data, algorithms and programming, computing systems and networks, and impact of computing. The curriculum engages students and supports the development of problem-solving skills, honing in on the computational thinking practices as indicated in the AP CSP curriculum framework. Students learn to create socially useful computational artifacts using MIT App Inventor as well as connect computing and learning about algorithms and data as they develop and analyze their programs. The curriculum also emphasizes communication and collaboration in a project-based approach. This course involves a strong writing component. Students will maintain a portfolio of their work, which will include several projects in the areas of programming and the impact of computing technology. 

At Santa Teresa High School, I teach AP Computer Science Principals (AP-CSP) using the <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/teach-mobilecsp/index.html">Mobile Computer Science Principles</a> (Mobile CSP) framework. Some of the questions asked of students are altered and lessons are supplemented with other material due to the popularity of the program, as well as many published digital portfolios available on the internet. As sections of this plan are introduced, I will include the common practices in my classroom, as well as links to supplemental materials used.

**Grade:** High School (10-12) 

**Societal Impacts to be incorporated into the course:** 

Throughout the year, impacts of technology on society as well as ethics are discussed, using the book, Blown to Bits, as the main resource. There are six lessons that specifically focus on large impacts of technology on society. In addition, throughout the lessons, there are other smaller impacts discussed, such as how data mining can be beneficial and what security concerns there might be. These smaller lessons are not included in this plan because the main outcomes in those lessons are not necessarily focused on the impact itself, but a larger result, such as manipulating data to find answers.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives
Lessons are presented using PowerPoint slides, with much of the material provided by Mobile CSP, including videos and other links. The slides begin with what will be discussed during the lesson or what the students will be able to do/know at the end of the lesson. Each of the lesson’s learning objectives here includes a link to what the student will be taught for you to view.

**Lesson 1.5 Impacts of CS Blown to Bits BB** 

<a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit1-Getting-Started/Impacts-of-CS-Blown-to-Bits-BB.html">This lesson </a>introduces the book that will be used for many of the global impact readings. In this unit, students are simply introduced to the textbook. In Unit 2, they will begin by reading Chapter 1. 

**Lesson 2.11 Impacts of CS The Digital Explosion** 

This is the <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit2-Intro-to-Mobile-Apps/Impacts-of-CS-The-Digital-Explosion.html">first lesson</a> that focuses explicitly on the societal impact of computing. Students will read the first chapter of the <em>Blown to Bits</em> book about the "digital explosion" - i.e., the idea that all of today's content (movies, books, images, sounds, etc.) is represented as bits (0s and 1s) and that the amount of such data is growing exponentially. In this and future <em>Blown to Bits</em> lessons, students will read and discuss and reflect upon various ways that computing affects their lives. This is one of the primary ways the global impact of computing, both positive and negative, is reinforced in the course. 

**Learning Objectives:** student will be able to 
- explain how data can be represented using bits 
- computing devices represent data digitally, meaning that the lowest-level components of any value are bits 

**Language Objectives:** student will be able to 
- summarize important topics from Chapter 1 of Blown to Bits by identifying main ideas, details and important quotes 
- describe how things around me use digital data using key vocabulary out loud and in writing, with the support of <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n-K4AQ_maHcXekzcfERQ9dxj91nqv9ytwJx4ZkAp8zw/copy">vocabulary notes</a> from this lesson.

<a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit3-Creating-Graphics-Images/Impacts-of-CS-Electronic-Documents.html">This lesson</a> focuses on some of the positive and negative implications of the fact that today "it's all bits" -- i.e., all digital information, including text, pictures, videos, and apps, are represented by binary digits. It focuses on the enduring understanding that variety of abstractions built on binary sequences can be used to represent all digital data. Students will read a section of the <em>Blown to Bits</em> that focuses on digital documents. They'll learn about how <em>meta data</em> in a document can be used to identify who created or modified the document, and how the bits that make up an image can be used to hide secret messages, a technique known as <em>steganography</em>. 

**Learning Objectives:** student will be able to

          </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><b>During Reading Activity (In-Class, 20 minutes or Homework): </b>Have the students read pp. 75-80. As students are reading, ask them to create "Conversation Questions" (template provided in the materials section) by doing the following: 
  <ul>
   <li>Highlight information that is important, surprising or thought provoking. Choose three or four pieces/ideas from the text. </li>
   <li>Once you have highlighted an idea, jot down a question about that idea that would be interesting to talk about with your classmates. Make your questions open-ended, that is questions that cannot be answered with simple one-word responses. Your open-ended questions may start with some of the following:
    <ul>
     <li>What did you think… </li>
     <li>Why do you think… </li>
     <li>How did you feel about… </li>
     <li>How could… </li>

  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<ul>
            <li><b>Making Connections: Small Group Discussion (20 minutes): </b>Break class up into groups of 2-4 students. Have students pose one of the discussion questions they created. Groups should then discuss each question. Once students have each asked a question, have students share an example of something that happened to them or that they read about that was similar in nature to what is presented in the chapter. Ask them to consider what advice they might give to the military and/or journalists to protect secret/protected information when posting on the Internet? Take a couple of minutes to check in with students about what they read. </li>
            <li><b>During Reading Activity (In-Class, 25 minutes or Homework): </b>Have the students read pp. 80-94, "Representation, Reality, and Illusion.” As students are reading, they should complete a "Now That’s Surprising" reading response sheet.

            <ul>
                <li>An idea that interests me or surprised me (include page #) </li>
                <li>What do I think about it? </li>
                <li>Why does it matter? </li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Making Connections: Small Group Discussion (20 minutes): </b>In their groups, have students share one idea from the reading that was interesting or surprising to them and what they thought about it. Then have students share examples of photo and video editing that they may have heard about. Ask them to think about their school pictures and what kind of editing happens to them. Have them create a timeline of audio formats (i.e. albums to 8-tracks to tapes to CDs to MP3 files) and then predict what the next digital audio format might be like. Take a couple of minutes to check in with students about what they read. </li>
            <li><b>During Reading Activity (In-Class, 25 minutes or Homework):</b> Have the students complete the steganography survey question then read pp. 95-99, "Hiding Information in Images." After reading this section, students should complete the steganography activity where they use a bitmap editor to hide three letters in an image following an algorithm for changing the decimal values of the pixel colors. Make sure students decode their images so they can check their work. If they're struggling, it might help to write the numbers down on paper with the byte values below each one. Students who finish early can start work on their portfolio reflections.</li>
            <li><b>Rethink, Reflect and/or Revise (15 minutes): </b>Have the students complete their portfolio reflections. Share portfolio responses, especially the free response questions. If time, share the BBC article about steganography being used with color printers and how it has impacted detective work. </li>

### Assessment 

<p>The lessons end with multiple choice questions, some from the AP College Board website, in the PowerPoint slides. Students will typically answer the questions vocally, as a group, and I will call on one student to explain why that answer is correct and the others are not. While Mobile CSP references a “portfolio,” I find it a lot easier to have students submit assignments directly to me via Google Classroom. Assignments are usually a group assignment (POGIL) and an individual reflection. The groups have been preassigned and change throughout the year so students have the opportunity to work with everyone in the class. Only one of the group member’s work is graded with all students in the group receiving that grade. The members do not know who will be chosen for grading. I keep a running tally of which member of each group has been used to keep it fair.</p>

<p><b>Lesson 1.5 Impacts of CS Blown to Bits BB </b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 25px;">This lesson does not include any type of assessment. It is just a small introductory lesson where I show students where to find the digital copy of the book I placed in the Google Drive for them.</p>
<p style="line-height: 5px;"><b>Lesson 2.11 Impacts of CS The Digital Explosion </b></p>
<p style="padding-left: 25px; line-height: 0x;">You can examine students’ work on the interactive exercise and their reflection portfolio entries to assess their progress on the following learning objectives. If students are able to do what is listed there, they are ready to move on to the next lesson. </p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Portfolio <a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!Ai4rrtIykb3V5SAwhSh_3xPTtkyK?e=hBD8sU">Reflections</a>:</b>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
   <li>LO 2.1.1 - Students should be able to describe how bits are used to store many different kinds of data (photos, files, video, etc.) </li>
   <li>LO 7.3.1 - Students should be able to describe how the digital explosion has both positive and negative impacts. Common examples include saving someone's life by using the cell phone to locate them (positive) and bullying on social media (negative). </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>In the class discussion, look for:</b>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
   <li>- Identification of both positive and negative impacts, without an overwhelming set of positive impacts </li>
   <li>- Completion of the double entry journal to help guide discussion </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><b>Differentiation: More Practice </b>
  <ul>
   <li>If students are struggling with the reading, consider making the readings in-class activities (silent reading or in groups) instead of a homework activity. After reading, students could make a slide for their assigned pages resulting in a collaborative class presentation for the chapter. Here is a Google presentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JmPL4QOV6-OHGoR7mOJ-u-fa2Kni0SZKvWO3ieSjGlM/edit#slide=id.p">template for Chapter 1</a>. </li>
   <li>Students could use the Chapter 1 vocabulary list to create flash cards or to re-write the definitions in their own words. </li>
   <li>Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWLBmapcJRU">a brief video</a> animation that explains the topic of Moore's Law. </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>Differentiation: Enrichment</b>
  <ul>
   <li>The chapter (on page 14) specifically mentions the positive and negative uses of encryption to keep emails to friends private but also allows terrorists to plan attacks undetected. Students could read and discuss articles related to the FBI's request of Apple to have them provide a backdoor decryption mechanism. <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/29/apple-vs-fbi-all-you-need-to-know.html">CNBC</a> provides a nice break-down of the key issues. </li>

### Outcome
<p>Part of the Mobile CSP teacher curriculum includes suggestions for inclusivity. The class population should be a representation of the school population, but it isn't. This is not the only subject that I teach, so I am able to discuss and show some of the amazing things that are happening in Computer Science to those other students. The one full time Computer Science teacher we have on campus is female with a Computer Science degree and experience in the industry. I will eventually be taking over for her when she retires (hopefully not too soon). I am also female. What I <b>am</b> seeing are female students who have fathers that are in some portion of the technology industry and the daughters want to follow in their footsteps! </p>
        <p>It is not uncommon to have students that are not proficient in the English language. With this being an AP course, the students are presented with words or terms that thay may not understand. There are two particular things that I do to help these student. The first is that I remind them they are sitting in front of a computer, which is a very powerful tool they can use to help them. The second is I will use the word in context to help them figure out a meaning for themselves. </p>
        <p>I encourage students to work with the people to their left and right. They work as a team and help explain information to each other in a way that they both understand. If something needs to be clarified, I help with context clues. I make sure to call on each student at some point in the class. It is difficult because there are those students who will always answer out loud, so there is a period of "training" that happens so students know when choral response is the way to answer, or wait for a student's name to be called so the individual student can answer.</p>

            <li>Encryption is the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Decryption is the process of decoding the data. Two common encryption approaches are: - Symmetric key encryption involves one key for both encryption and decryption. - Public key encryption pairs a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message, but the receiver’s private key is required to decrypt the message. Exclusion Statement (EK IOC-2.B.5): Specific mathematical procedures for encryption and decryption are beyond the scope of this course and the AP Exam.</li>
            <li>Computer virus and malware scanning software can help protect a computing system against infection.</li>
            <li>A computer virus is a malicious program that can copy itself and gain access to a computer in an unauthorized way. Computer viruses often attach themselves to legitimate programs and start running independently on a computer.</li>
