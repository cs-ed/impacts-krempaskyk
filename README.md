# Impacts on Society

**Course:** AP Computer Science Principals 

**Description:** The Mobile Computer Science Principles course provides an introduction to the basic principles of computer science (CS) from the perspective of mobile computing, including programming in MIT App Inventor, a graphical programming language for Android and iOS mobile devices. The lessons and materials used by students incorporate algorithms and programming while also integrating all other AP CSP big ideas: creative development, data, algorithms and programming, computing systems and networks, and impact of computing. The curriculum engages students and supports the development of problem-solving skills, honing in on the computational thinking practices as indicated in the AP CSP curriculum framework. Students learn to create socially useful computational artifacts using MIT App Inventor as well as connect computing and learning about algorithms and data as they develop and analyze their programs. The curriculum also emphasizes communication and collaboration in a project-based approach. This course involves a strong writing component. Students will maintain a portfolio of their work, which will include several projects in the areas of programming and the impact of computing technology. 

**Grade:** High School (9-12) 

**How societal impacts be incorporated into the course:** 

At Santa Teresa High School, I teach AP Computer Science Principals using the Mobile Computer Science Principles framework. Some of the questions asked of students are altered and lessons are supplemented with other material. Throughout the year, impacts of technology on society as well as ethics are discussed, using the book, Blown to Bits, as the main resource. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

**Lesson 1.5 Impacts of CS Blown to Bits BB** 
This lesson introduces the book that will be used for many of the global impact readings. In this unit, students are simply introduced to the textbook. In Unit 2, they will begin by reading Chapter 1. 

**Lesson 2.11 Impacts of CS The Digital Explosion** 
This is the first lesson that focuses explicitly on the societal impact of computing. Students will read the first chapter of the Blown to Bits book about the "digital explosion" - i.e., the idea that all of today's content (movies, books, images, sounds, etc.) is represented as bits (0s and 1s) and that the amount of such data is growing exponentially. In this and future Blown to Bits lessons, students will read and discuss and reflect upon various ways that computing affects their lives. This is one of the primary ways the global impact of computing, both positive and negative, is reinforced in the course. 

Learning Objectives: student will learn to 
o	explain how data can be represented using bits 
o	computing devices represent data digitally, meaning that the lowest-level components of any value are bits 
Language Objectives: student will be able to 
o	summarize important topics from Chapter 1 of Blown to Bits by identifying main ideas, details and important quotes 
o	describe how things around me use digital data using key vocabulary out loud and in writing, with the support of vocabulary notes from this lesson. 
 


### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
