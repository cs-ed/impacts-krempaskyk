# Impacts on Society

**Course:** AP Computer Science Principals 

**Description:** The Mobile Computer Science Principles course provides an introduction to the basic principles of computer science (CS) from the perspective of mobile computing, including programming in MIT App Inventor, a graphical programming language for Android and iOS mobile devices. The lessons and materials used by students incorporate algorithms and programming while also integrating all other AP CSP big ideas: creative development, data, algorithms and programming, computing systems and networks, and impact of computing. The curriculum engages students and supports the development of problem-solving skills, honing in on the computational thinking practices as indicated in the AP CSP curriculum framework. Students learn to create socially useful computational artifacts using MIT App Inventor as well as connect computing and learning about algorithms and data as they develop and analyze their programs. The curriculum also emphasizes communication and collaboration in a project-based approach. This course involves a strong writing component. Students will maintain a portfolio of their work, which will include several projects in the areas of programming and the impact of computing technology. 

**Grade:** High School (9-12) 

**How societal impacts be incorporated into the course:** 

At Santa Teresa High School, I teach AP Computer Science Principals using the <a href="https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/teach-mobilecsp/index.html">Mobile Computer Science Principles</a> framework. Some of the questions asked of students are altered and lessons are supplemented with other material. Throughout the year, impacts of technology on society as well as ethics are discussed, using the book, Blown to Bits, as the main resource. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

**Lesson 1.5 Impacts of CS Blown to Bits BB** 

<a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit1-Getting-Started/Impacts-of-CS-Blown-to-Bits-BB.html">This lesson </a>introduces the book that will be used for many of the global impact readings. In this unit, students are simply introduced to the textbook. In Unit 2, they will begin by reading Chapter 1. 

**Lesson 2.11 Impacts of CS The Digital Explosion** 

This is the <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit2-Intro-to-Mobile-Apps/Impacts-of-CS-The-Digital-Explosion.html">first lesson</a> that focuses explicitly on the societal impact of computing. Students will read the first chapter of the Blown to Bits book about the "digital explosion" - i.e., the idea that all of today's content (movies, books, images, sounds, etc.) is represented as bits (0s and 1s) and that the amount of such data is growing exponentially. In this and future Blown to Bits lessons, students will read and discuss and reflect upon various ways that computing affects their lives. This is one of the primary ways the global impact of computing, both positive and negative, is reinforced in the course. 

**Learning Objectives:** student will be able to 
- explain how data can be represented using bits 
- computing devices represent data digitally, meaning that the lowest-level components of any value are bits 

**Language Objectives:** student will be able to 
- summarize important topics from Chapter 1 of Blown to Bits by identifying main ideas, details and important quotes 
- describe how things around me use digital data using key vocabulary out loud and in writing, with the support of <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n-K4AQ_maHcXekzcfERQ9dxj91nqv9ytwJx4ZkAp8zw/copy">vocabulary notes</a> from this lesson. 
 
**Lesson 3.10 Impacts of CS Electronic Documents** 

<a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit3-Creating-Graphics-Images/Impacts-of-CS-Electronic-Documents.html">This lesson</a> focuses on some of the positive and negative implications of the fact that today "it's all bits" -- i.e., all digital information, including text, pictures, videos, and apps, are represented by binary digits. It focuses on the enduring understanding that variety of abstractions built on binary sequences can be used to represent all digital data. Students will read a section of the Blown to bits that focuses on digital documents. They'll learn about how meta data in a document can be used to identify who created or modified the document, and how the bits that make up an image can be used to hide secret messages, a technique known as <em>steganography</em>. 

**Learning Objectives:** student will be able to 
- describe digital models and their renderings as abstractions
- differentiate between data and metadata
- describe what information can be extracted from metadata

**Language Objectives:** student will be able to 
- discuss the beneficial and harmful effects of computing innovations
- use target vocabulary, such as <font color="green>modeling</font>, and render, while discussing digital models, with the support of concept definitions and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pfrv_g1AGKNFPmgir1uGApfHtkhB783Te5kzVz5FZ8c/copy">vocabulary notes</a> from this lesson

**Lesson 4.10 Impacts of CS Privacy Explore Curricular Activity** 

<a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit4-Animation-Simulation-Modeling/Impacts-of-CS-Privacy-Explore-Curricular-Activity.html">This lesson</a> focuses on the global impact issue of privacy and security. Students are encouraged to think more deeply about the data trails that they leave as they use computers and what their responsibilities are while developing mobile apps. There is an optional debate activity where students can delve deeper into the topic of privacy. 

**Learning Objectives:** student will be able to
