# Impacts on Society

**Course:** AP Computer Science Principals 

**Description:** The Mobile Computer Science Principles course provides an introduction to the basic principles of computer science (CS) from the perspective of mobile computing, including programming in MIT App Inventor, a graphical programming language for Android and iOS mobile devices. The lessons and materials used by students incorporate algorithms and programming while also integrating all other AP CSP big ideas: creative development, data, algorithms and programming, computing systems and networks, and impact of computing. The curriculum engages students and supports the development of problem-solving skills, honing in on the computational thinking practices as indicated in the AP CSP curriculum framework. Students learn to create socially useful computational artifacts using MIT App Inventor as well as connect computing and learning about algorithms and data as they develop and analyze their programs. The curriculum also emphasizes communication and collaboration in a project-based approach. This course involves a strong writing component. Students will maintain a portfolio of their work, which will include several projects in the areas of programming and the impact of computing technology. 

**Grade:** High School (9-12) 

**How societal impacts be incorporated into the course:** 

At Santa Teresa High School, I teach AP Computer Science Principals using the Mobile Computer Science Principles framework. Some of the questions asked of students are altered and lessons are supplemented with other material. Throughout the year, impacts of technology on society as well as ethics are discussed, using the book, Blown to Bits, as the main resource. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
